# eeng415Proj1
This is project 1 from EENG 415 Data Science for EE at Colorado School of Mines. In this project, I identified factors that could qualify someone to be socioeconomically vulnerable, and used these factors to create a dataset using US census data. I then performed data pre-processing and dimensionality reduction by using PCA. Finally, I computed a vulnerability level for each census tract and overlayed them on a map of the greater Denver area.
