# eeng415Proj1
This is project 1 from EENG 415 Data Science for EE at Colorado School of Mines. In this project, I identified factors that could qualify someone to be socioeconomically vulnerable, and used these factors to create a dataset using US census data. I then performed data pre-processing and dimensionality reduction by using PCA. Finally, I computed a vulnerability level for each census tract and overlayed them on a map of the greater Denver area. Project1EENG415.pdf is a formal report for the project that elaborates more on the processes described here.

# Running the MATLAB Code
To run the MATLAB code, ensure that eeng415Proj1Data.xlxs is in the same directory as the EENG415project1.m file.
